### Overview
### The Challenge
The challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries V2 API to pull country data and display it like in the designs . You are required to use the React + TypeScript front-end framework.
Your users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. See all countries from the API on the homepage
3. Search for a country using an input field
4. Filter countries by region
5. Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
6. Click through to the border countries on the detail page
7. Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode
